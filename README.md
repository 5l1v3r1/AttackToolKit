# AttackToolKit

The ATK is an open-source exploiting framework for Windows. The plugin-based system allows the detection and exploitation of vulnerabilities. With such a proof-of-concept the existence and severity of security holes can be determined. This application has been discussed in several books and papers about professional vulnerability assessments. The software has been ported to different platforms (e.g. ANSI C, C#, Ruby).
